AI agents are autonomous systems that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. They can range from simple rule-based systems to complex learning-based models that adapt over time.

## Key Components

1. **Perception** - How agents understand their environment
2. **Decision Making** - How agents choose actions based on their understanding
3. **Action** - How agents affect change in their environment
4. **Learning** - How agents improve performance over time

## Popular Frameworks
